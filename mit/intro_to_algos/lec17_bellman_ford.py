# Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest paths
# 1) Assign zero to starting node and infinity (âˆž) to all other nodes: distance = {}
# 2) for i from 0 to len(vertices)
#       for edge(u, v) with weight w in edges:
#           // relaxing
#           if distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
#               distance[v] = distance[u] + w
# 3) Check for negative weight cycles
#       for edge(u, v) with weight w in edges:
#           if distance[u] + w < distance[v]:
#               report "Graph contains negative edges"
# Complexity: O(|V|*|E|)
# Bellman-Ford vs Dijkstra: Bellman-Ford can work with graphs with negative weights
# and can detect negative weight cycles
#
# After |V| - 1 passes, if we find a distance[v] that can be relaxed, then
# this means the graph has a negative weight cycle
