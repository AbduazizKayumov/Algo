package syntax

/*
* Why Kotlin?
* 1) Kotlin is 100% operable with Java, everything runs on Java, it will run on Kotlin
* 2) Beautiful syntax - Kotlin can decrease your Java code to 40-60 %
* 3) Automatic type inference:
*       a = 9
*       b = "Hello" // you don't have to declare a string var as a string again
* 4) Smart casts
*    Kotlin checks for code logic and smart casts types:
*    if (a is String){
*       print(a.toUpperCase())
*    }
* 5) No getters and setters
* 6) Extension functions
* 7) Null safety with ?
